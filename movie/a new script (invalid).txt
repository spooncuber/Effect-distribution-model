# I haven't learned how to apply this script to generate video, but I think I understant how it works. 
# So I check the video and choose the fragments that I think is good for explanation.
# I replace the first fragment because the old one doesn't represent an obvious result.
# I also choose last two fragments to show the limitation of method.
# And make the note a break between two fragments.

# One suggestion:
# Can you move the explanatory note to the top? Cause it cover some pedetrians now, and there are few pedestrians at the top.
