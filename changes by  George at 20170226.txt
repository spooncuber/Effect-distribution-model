The following are changes compared with the commmit called 'amend related work' on git.

Sec. II
Change a few insignificant words.

Sec. III
Add some sentences to introduce the concept of subgoal.(leave this change alone, I don't think this change will make it better.)

Sec. IV
Change some words, which I think they're more suitable for paper.
Part A: Use the word 'subgoal' more, I think it's an excellent word to improve significance of trajectory fitting.
Part D: Introduce two weight variables alpha and beta in Eq. 2 (same in Eq.3), and explain how to avoid edge effect of KDE in our method.

Sec. V
Replace the evaluation table by a pie figure, cause the old table looks poor.
Add a figure and detailed description for destination prediction.
